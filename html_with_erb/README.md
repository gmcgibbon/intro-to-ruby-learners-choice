## HTML with ERB

HTML templating in ruby is done with ERB (Embedded Ruby). ERB is also template language agnostic meaning you can use it with plain text, XML, JSON, and even ruby files themselves! If you want to build web applications in ruby, its a good idea to use a framework where most of the templating code is provided.

### Sinatra

Sinatra is a simple, lightweight framework for building web apps. https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra

### Ruby on Rails

Rails is a more complex Model View Controller (MVC) framework used to build web apps. https://github.com/rails/rails

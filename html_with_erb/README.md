## HTML with ERB

HTML templating in ruby is done with ERB (Embedded Ruby). ERB is template language agnostic meaning you can use it with plain text, XML, JSON, and even other ruby files!

If you want to build web applications with ruby, its better to use a framework than plain old ERB. Depending on the complexity of your project, Sinatra, Middleman, and Ruby on Rails are all great choices.

### Sinatra

[Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) is a simple framework for building web apps.

### Middleman

[Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) is a sinatra-like framework for building static web apps.

### Ruby on Rails

[Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) is a more complex [Model View Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework used to build web apps.
